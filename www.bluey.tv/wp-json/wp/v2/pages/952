For example to enable you to navigate the service, to remember your cookie preferences, to keep our service secure and for system administration, such as preventing fraudulent or disruptive activity;<\/li><li><strong>To provide additional functionality <\/strong>that improves your experience or that you<br>have requested. For example, to remember your preferences and settings.<\/li><li><strong>To analyse and improve performance of our services.<\/strong> &nbsp;For example, to help us to know how many users we have, which parts of our sites are most popular, what browsers are used (so we can maximise compatibility), the country or region where our users are located, and the demographics and interests of our users. This enables us to understand better who is using our site, to ensure we are reaching our target demographic, and to improve and tailor our services accordingly. We might also use cookies to measure the<br>effectiveness of our marketing campaigns (online and by email).<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On services which contain advertising*, and through BBC Studios marketing shown to you elsewhere online, our advertising partners also use cookies to enable them and their advertisers to monitor the effectiveness of their ads (e.g. by using statistical analysis cookies), to prevent fraud and to limit the number of times they show you a particular ad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>To provide social media functionality, referral links and third party embedded content.<\/strong> We sometimes provide sharing buttons to enable you to share content via social media or we use third parties to provide video content on the service. These companies may use cookies stored on your browser\/device which are associated with your account with them or otherwise enable them to track your use of their services. Details of which are used on this service are provided in the next section. Please be aware that these companies are responsible for these cookies and their use of your data.<\/li><li><strong>To personalise advertising shown to you on the service, or BBC Studios marketing shown to you elsewhere online.<\/strong> Some of our services* carry advertising that helps us to pay for creating and delivering content to you. &nbsp;This advertising may be personalised based on your web browsing and inferred interests.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We and our partners may use cookies, as well your IP address or network location, to know which pages on the service you visit and your city or region. This information is sometimes combined with other data collected about your browsing of other websites or from specialist data companies to derive what may interest you so that you can be placed in an interest segment, such as \u201ctravel\u201d or \u201cautos\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may also allow advertisers to use their own marketing data to target advertising campaigns on this service and as a result, you may see advertising based upon website content you have been viewing on another website. For example, a retailer might use information about the products you browsed on their website in order to tailor their advert to you on this website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are committed to following best practice in our use of online behavioural targeting technology and we at all times seek to comply with applicable regulatory frameworks, such as that of the European Digital Advertising Alliance.

The cookie stores a unique identifier, a string of characters, which enables a website or technology provider to recognise your browser or device, for example when you revisit a page or site or click on a link or advert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cookies may be stored by the website you are visiting (a \u201cfirst party cookie\u201d) or by another organisation providing services to that website, such as an analytics company, advertising network or social media platform (a \u201cthird party cookie\u201d). They will either be stored for the duration of your visit (a \u201csession cookie\u201d) or they will remain on your device for a fixed period (usually several months, or longer) to remember you across multiple browsing sessions (a \u201cpersistent cookie\u201d).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Other types of local storage, such as Adobe Flash Cookies and HTML5 Storage<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many websites use local storage technologies that are similar to cookies but enable larger amounts of data to be stored. This means they can store information like your preferences, game data and viewing history on your device rather than on their own systems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tracking technologies, such as web beacons and page tags<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Website publishers and technology providers use embedded code to record how you interact with them (recognising your browser\/device via the unique ID stored in their cookie or the device Advertising ID). They are used to help website and app publishers to better analyse and improve their services and to target advertising based on your browsing behaviour and interests. For example, by knowing which web pages you visit or which elements of a page you viewed, when and for how long, whether you viewed and\/or clicked on an advert on the site or whether you opened or clicked on marketing emails sent to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tracking via Apps<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies are unable to use cookies within Mobile Apps. Instead they use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as the device Advertising ID (a random and resettable ID on your device), and other data such as your geo-location or your network location. This data is used in the same way as cookies, e.g. to analyse and improve services and to serve marketing and advertising to you (if the App is funded by advertising).<\/p>\n<\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":70,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"gbl_sidebar_theme_meta_field":["default-theme"]},"acf":{"geo_location":[]},"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.14 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Cookies Policy - Bluey Official Website<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"You can read our cookie policy online at any time.
