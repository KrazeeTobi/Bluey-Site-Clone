<p>Please read these Official Rules carefully before entering the Bluey Toy Sweepstakes (the “Sweepstakes”). </p>



<p>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER. VOID WHERE PROHIBITED.</p>
</section>



<section class="wp-block-bbc-rich-text" aria-label="Rich Text Content">
<h2><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Eligibility</strong></h2>



<p>The Sweepstakes is open only to legal residents of the fifty (50) United States (including the District of Columbia) who are sixteen (16) years of age or older at the time of entry. Employees of BBC Studios Americas, Inc., its affiliates, promotional partners, as well as the immediate family (spouse, parents, siblings, and children) and household members of each of foregoing are not eligible to enter. The Sweepstakes is subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations and is void where prohibited by law. If you are a deemed a minor in your state of residence, you must have the consent of your parent or legal guardian to participate in this Sweepstakes. Proof of consent may be required at any time.</p>



<h2>2<strong>.</strong> <strong>Sponsor</strong></h2>



<p>The Sweepstakes is sponsored by BBC Studios Americas, Inc., 1120 Avenue of the Americas, FL 5, New York, NY 10036 (the “Sponsor”). The BBC Code of Conduct (the “Code”) for competitions can be found at <a href="https://www.bbc.com/editorialguidelines/guidance/code-of-conduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://www.bbc.com/editorialguidelines/guidance/code-of-conduct (opens in a new tab)">https://www.bbc.com/editorialguidelines/guidance/code-of-conduct</a>&nbsp; and all Sponsor promotions comply with the Code. </p>



<h2><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Agreement to Official Rules</strong></h2>



<p>Participation
in the Sweepstakes constitutes each entrant’s full and unconditional agreement
to and acceptance of these Official Rules and the decisions of the Sponsor
which are final and binding. Winning a prize is contingent upon fulfilling all
requirements set forth herein in a timely manner.</p>



<h2><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Entry Period</strong></h2>



<p>The Sweepstakes shall consist one (1) entry period as follows: beginning on June 23, 2020 and ends on June 27, 2020 at 11:59 PM EST. Entries received prior to or after an Entry Period will be disqualified. The use of any agencies or automated software to submit entries will void all entries submitted by that person. </p>



<h2><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Entry</strong></h2>



<p>During
the Entry Period, answer the trivia question at bluey.tv (the “Trivia
Question”) with the correct answer to the Trivia Question. There is a limit of
one (1) entry per person. Subsequent entries will be void.</p>



<h2><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Drawing</strong></h2>



<p>Within
forty-eight (48) hours of the end of each Entry Period, the Sponsor shall
select a potential winner in a random drawing of all entries received. The odds
of being selected depend on the number of eligible entries received. The
Sponsor will attempt to notify the potential winner(s) within seventy-two (72)
hours of the drawing. If a potential winner does not respond within seventy-two
(72) hours after the first attempt to contact him/her, the Sponsor will select
an alternate potential winner in his/her place at random from all entries
received.</p>



<h2><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Requirements of Potential Winners</strong> </h2>



<p>Except
where prohibited, a potential winner may be required to complete and return an
affidavit of eligibility and liability/publicity release (the
“Affidavit/Release”) within fourteen (14) calendar days of being notified. If a
potential winner fails to sign and return the Affidavit/Release within the
required time period, an alternate entrant will be selected in his/her place in
a random drawing of all entries received. If a prize is valued at $600 or more,
the potential winner will be required to fill out and return a W-9 form within
fourteen (14) calendar days of being notified. </p>



<h2><strong>8.</strong> <strong>Prize</strong></h2>



<p>The prize for the Sweepstakes is one (1) of three (3) Bluey jumbo plush toys each with an approximate retail value of Nineteen Dollars and Ninety Nine Cents ($19.99 USD). No cash or other substitution may be made, except by the Sponsor, who reserves the right to substitute a prize with another prize of equal or greater value if the advertised prize is not available for any reason as determined by the Sponsor in its sole discretion. The winner is responsible for all taxes associated with the prize. Once each winner is selected and notified, each winner shall not be entitled to transfer or sell the prize(s) to any other third party, even in the event that such third party would otherwise have been entitled to enter the Sweepstakes. Should a winner sell or attempt to sell its prize, the winner will be disqualified and Sponsor will select a new winner. Each prize is awarded “as is” and without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. </p>



<h2><strong>9.</strong> <strong>Privacy</strong></h2>



<p>All information submitted as part of this Sweepstakes will be treated in accordance with the Sponsor’s Privacy Policy (available at <a href="https://www.bbcstudios.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://www.bbcstudios.com/privacy/ (opens in a new tab)">https://www.bbcstudios.com/privacy/</a>). Sponsor will only ever use each entrant’s personal details for the purposes of administering the Sweepstakes and will not publish them or provide them to anyone without permission.</p>



<h2>1<strong>0.</strong> <strong>Publicity</strong> </h2>



<p>Except where prohibited, participation in the Sweepstakes constitutes each winner’s consent to the Sponsor’s use of the winner’s name, likeness, voice, biographical information, and state of residence for promotional purposes in any media without further payment or consideration.</p>



<h2><strong>11.</strong> <strong>General Conditions</strong> </h2>



<p>In
the event that the operation, security, or administration of the Sweepstakes is
impaired in any way for any reason, including, but not limited to fraud, virus,
or other technical problem, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, either:
(a) suspend the Sweepstakes to address the impairment and then resume the
Sweepstakes in a manner that best conforms to the spirit of these Official
Rules; or (b) award the prize(s) at random from among the eligible entries
received up to the time of the impairment. Sponsor reserves the right in its
sole discretion to disqualify any individual it finds to be tampering with the
entry process or the operation of the Sweepstakes or to be acting in violation
of these Official Rules or in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner. Any
attempt by any person to undermine the legitimate operation of the Sweepstakes
may be a violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be
made, the Sponsor reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to
the fullest extent permitted by law. The Sponsor’s failure to enforce any term
of these Official Rules shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. If the
identity of an entrant is disputed, the authorized email account holder at the
time of entry will be deemed to be the entrant. An entrant may be required to
provide proof that he/she is the authorized accountholder of the email account
associated with the selected entry. The sole determinant of time for the
purposes of receipt of a valid entry in the Sweepstakes will be the Sponsor’s
computer. Sponsor reserves the right to amend these terms and conditions or to
cancel, alter or amend the Official Rules or the Prize at any stage, if deemed
necessary in its opinion, or if circumstances arise outside of its control.</p>



<h2><strong>12.</strong> <strong>Release and Limitations of Liability</strong> </h2>



<p>By participating in the Sweepstakes, each entrant agrees to release and hold harmless the Sponsor and its officers, directors, employees, and agents (the “Released Parties”) from and against any claim or cause of action arising out of participation in the Sweepstakes or receipt or use of any prize, including, but not limited to: (a) unauthorized human intervention in the Sweepstakes; (b) technical errors related to computers, servers, providers, or telephone or network lines; (c) printing errors; (d) lost, late, postage-due, misdirected, or undeliverable mail; (e) errors in the administration of the Sweepstakes or the processing of entries; or (f) injury or damage to persons or property which may be caused, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, from entrant’s participation in the Sweepstakes or receipt of any prize. Entrant further agrees that in any cause of action, the Released Parties’ liability will be limited to the cost of entering and participating in the Sweepstakes, and in no event shall the Released Parties be liable for attorneys’ fees.</p>



<h2><strong>13.</strong> <strong>Disputes</strong></h2>



<p>Except
where prohibited, each entrant agrees that any and all disputes, claims and
causes of action arising out of, or connected with, the Sweepstakes or any
prize awarded shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of
class action, and exclusively by the appropriate court located in the State of
New York. All issues and questions concerning the construction, validity,
interpretation and enforceability of these Official Rules, entrant’s rights and
obligations, or the rights and obligations of the Released Parties in
connection with the Sweepstakes, shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law rules (whether of the State of New York or
any other jurisdiction), which would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of New York.</p>
