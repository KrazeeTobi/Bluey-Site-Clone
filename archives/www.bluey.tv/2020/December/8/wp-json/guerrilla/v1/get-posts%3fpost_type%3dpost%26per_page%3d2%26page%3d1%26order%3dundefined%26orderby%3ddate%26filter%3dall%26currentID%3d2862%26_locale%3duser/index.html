I\u2019d kept in contact with Joe when I left and when he heard I was going to London he offered to train me in the program the animation companies were using over there, CelAction. We did a crash course in 4 days. And it was that snippet of animation that someone saw online 6 months later which got me my first job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that, I worked for a couple of UK companies before getting an email from Joe saying he was working on something new and wanted me to come animate on it but also train some animators. We created a 4-week course and I trained our first three animators that started on the production, then the next 10 animators and then another five and so on.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What made you get into Animation?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From the age of 14 I knew I wanted to be an animator. I spent my Christmas holidays that year following online tutorials to get better at drawing. I then did an online animation course at 15 while still at school. I loved Disney, Pixar and Studio Ghibli films and used to watch all the behind the scenes extras on the dvds. I always knew I wanted to work in 2D animation as I loved the process of making cartoons more than the process of 3D animation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>So, what does it mean to be an Animation Director?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My role is to supervise and guide the designers, animators and vfx artists in the right direction for producing the look and feel of the animation for each episode. For example, I will check the designers work, test the props and characters they\u2019ve rigged to make sure it fits the purpose required for animation. If it\u2019s off model or not user friendly, it\u2019s my responsibility to figure out with the designers how to improve it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the animation department, I do continuous checks of their work before it gets to the Director to make sure we\u2019re delivering the correct performances and quality. So at each stage of the animation: rough keys, inbetweens, lip sync, I check their work and provide feedback to make it the best it can be. I\u2019m constantly managing multiple episodes at once &#8211; all at different stages of completion. I remember being across seven at one point. There\u2019s a whole other side that includes managing files, exporting episodes and attending multiple briefs and meetings, but the bulk of my time is working with each person individually. It\u2019s quite a face-to-face role, which I really enjoy!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What has been your favourite episode of Bluey?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite episode has been Escape. It was just such a fun and clever idea. I love the look of those kid-style drawings and the sketchy-ness to them. It\u2019s the way I love to draw, not fully coloured in &#8211; seeing little streaks of white through the artwork. Plus, the story the characters create is just hilarious!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What character do you relate to the most?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite character has to be Bingo. We\u2019re both a little sensitive, have ginger hair and look up to our older sister. I love how quirky Bingo is, making up new names for herself all the time, saying things in funny voices. She really invests herself in the games they play. And she\u2019s a kind and caring soul who thinks about others a lot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What&#8217;s the best part of your job?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&nbsp;don\u2019t think there\u2019s just one thing that makes working on Bluey an amazing experience\u2026 but to name a few: being surrounded by other creative and energetic people who love what they do makes me look forward to coming to work every day. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/IMG_0695-3-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4253\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/IMG_0695-3-1024x1024.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/IMG_0695-3-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/IMG_0695-3-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/IMG_0695-3-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/IMG_0695-3-1536x1536.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/IMG_0695-3.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to work in Brisbane is a major dream come true. Working on clever and entertaining stories &#8211; that don\u2019t just resonate with children, but adults too. Helping animators improve on their skills is something I find enjoyable. I quite like teaching, which is probably why I\u2019ve done the training course 5 times now haha. Oh, and I can\u2019t forget that my dog also loves my job as she gets to come into work most days! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/animationdirector_interview_pic-1-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4254\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/animationdirector_interview_pic-1-768x1023.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/animationdirector_interview_pic-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/animationdirector_interview_pic-1.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bbc-share-buttons social-buttons-holder\" aria-label=\"Collection of buttons to share on social media channels\"><div class=\"share-buttons\"><span>Share: <\/span><a class=\"icon__social icon__social--facebook__share\" href=\"https:\/\/facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/?p=4248\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Share on Facebook\">Share on Facebook<\/a><a class=\"icon__social icon__social--twitter__share\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet\/?text=BETH HARVEY \u2013 Animation Director&amp;url=https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/?p=4248\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Share on Twitter\">Share on Twitter<\/a><a class=\"icon__social icon__social--copy-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/?p=4248\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Copy URL\">Copy URL<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<section id=\"fe-dynamic-posts-grid\" class=\"wp-block-bbc-dynamic-posts-grid fe-dynamic-posts-grid\" aria-label=\"More Posts\" data-props=\"{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;More Posts&quot;,&quot;postType&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;load&quot;:2,&quot;orderby&quot;:&quot;date&quot;,&quot;enableFilter&quot;:false,&quot;enableResultCount&quot;:false,&quot;enableLoadMore&quot;:false,&quot;enableButton&quot;:true,&quot;buttonLabel&quot;:&quot;All posts&quot;,&quot;buttonUrl&quot;:&quot;\/grown-ups&quot;,&quot;enableFeaturedPost&quot;:false}\"><\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How did you join the Bluey team?&nbsp; Well, Joe Brumm (the creator of Bluey) was my lecturer for a year at university.

There weren&#8217;t a lot of jobs around after I graduated, so I took whatever I could. Prior to janitoring, I did a number of short contract and freelance work as a 2D animator, but the opportunities were small.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, I did a storyboard test for DisneyTV in Los Angeles. They liked my work and invited me to LA but rejected me upon realising that I wasn\u2019t living in the States. I was very disappointed, but I held onto my test. And I\u2019m glad that I did, because the test was what I used to apply to a Ludo Studio job listing for work on a dog show in July 2017. A month later, I had a skype call with Joe Brumm and was asked to move to Brisbane to work on Bluey. I quit my janitor job the following day.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Did you always want to work as an artist in animation?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently, I started drawing when I was 2 years old. One of my earliest memories is drawing on the walls while hiding behind our couch, then standing up to view whether it would be noticeable to my parents or not. I watched a lot of television as a child (we lived next to a video shop) and I was obsessed with Pixar movies. I knew I wanted to work in animation quite early on but didn\u2019t realise that I preferred storyboarding over animating until after university. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t particularly remember when it hit me, but at some point I realised that I really enjoyed helping craft the story instead of producing the final product. Despite that, I did some background art for season 2 and loved it. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Walk me through the role of a Storyboard artist and your process?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Storyboards are like blueprints &#8211; they form a basis for the artists in the next stages of production. The role of a storyboard artist is to translate the script and the director\u2019s vision into images by creating a series of drawings or \u201cpanels\u201d that plan out the different shots and scenes within the episode. We are the first artists in the chain and work very closely with the creator and writer, Joe Brumm. Really, they\u2019re like black and white versions of the episode and take between 3 to 4 weeks to complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-2-1-1024x649.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4242\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-2-1-1024x649.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-2-1-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-2-1-768x487.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-2-1-1536x973.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-2-1.jpg 2026w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>After a table read with Joe (literally sitting at a table reading the script together) I will start work on the first draft of the board. I will then apply changes to the board according to Joe\u2019s feedback and then continue working on it until completion.&nbsp;I spend&nbsp;a lot of time just sitting and envisioning the characters talking in my head.&nbsp;A finished Bluey storyboard can range from 500-900 panels depending on the complexity of the episode.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-1-1024x650.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4243\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-1-1024x650.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-1-300x190.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-1-768x487.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-1-1536x974.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Jasmine_Drawing-1.jpg 2018w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What has been your favourite episode to board so far?<em>&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>My favourite episode that I\u2019ve storyboarded would have to be&#8230; a tie between \u2018Camping\u2019 and \u2018Sleepytime\u2019. It&#8217;s tricky &#8211; I love them both so much. I actually teared up when I was in the middle of boarding \u2018Camping\u2019 &#8211; I shared a similar experience to Bluey and Jean Luc when I was a kid. I\u2019m also&nbsp;<em>really<\/em>&nbsp;into flashbacks and flashforwards, so getting to draw Bluey as a teenager was life-giving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>If you could be any character in Bluey, who would you be<\/strong>?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Muffin is my favourite character in the series, but I relate to Pom Pom from \u2018Seesaw\u2019 the most, because she\u2019s small but hardy &#8211; like me. There\u2019s actually a background character in the episode \u2018Ice Cream\u2019 that is based on me. I\u2019m a white, fluffy dog with a curly tail and I&#8217;m holding my favourite dessert. I also voiced the takeaway lady in \u2018Takeaway\u2019, so technically that\u2019s me too. I take on many forms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BTS-InterviewWithJasmine.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4244\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BTS-InterviewWithJasmine.png 697w, https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/BTS-InterviewWithJasmine-300x258.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What&#8217;s the best part about working on Bluey?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part of working on Bluey would have to be the people I work with. The studio is filled to the brim with kind and talented artists. I&#8217;m very thankful to be a part of such a wonderful team. A big plus is that I get to tell people that I work on a show they love and see their faces light up. Also, Bagel Day in the office is good &#8211; the day where we get free bagels. I like the blueberry bagels. And I guess the fact that I get to draw dogs for money is also a plus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-bbc-share-buttons social-buttons-holder\" aria-label=\"Collection of buttons to share on social media channels\"><div class=\"share-buttons\"><span>Share: <\/span><a class=\"icon__social icon__social--facebook__share\" href=\"https:\/\/facebook.com\/sharer\/sharer.php?u=https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/?p=4234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Share on Facebook\">Share on Facebook<\/a><a class=\"icon__social icon__social--twitter__share\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet\/?text=Jasmine Moody - Storyboard artist&amp;url=https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/?p=4234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Share on Twitter\">Share on Twitter<\/a><a class=\"icon__social icon__social--copy-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bluey.tv\/?p=4234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" aria-label=\"Copy URL\">Copy URL<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<section id=\"fe-dynamic-posts-grid\" class=\"wp-block-bbc-dynamic-posts-grid fe-dynamic-posts-grid\" aria-label=\"More Posts\" data-props=\"{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;More Posts&quot;,&quot;postType&quot;:&quot;post&quot;,&quot;load&quot;:2,&quot;orderby&quot;:&quot;date&quot;,&quot;enableFilter&quot;:false,&quot;enableResultCount&quot;:false,&quot;enableLoadMore&quot;:false,&quot;enableButton&quot;:true,&quot;buttonLabel&quot;:&quot;All posts&quot;,&quot;buttonUrl&quot;:&quot;\/grown-ups&quot;,&quot;enableFeaturedPost&quot;:false}\"><\/section>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How did you join the Bluey team?
